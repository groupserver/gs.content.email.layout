Viewlets
========

The email layout uses two viewlet managers. The
``groupserver.emailStyle`` manager supplies the CSS that lays out
the message [#css]_. The footer is supplied by the
``groupserver.emailFooter``, which is provided by this product.

Within the footer there is one viewlet by default:
``gs-content-email-layout-footer``. It links to the Privacy
policy, Acceptable use policy, and the About page for the
site. The links to these pages gives some semblance of propriety
to the email notification.
